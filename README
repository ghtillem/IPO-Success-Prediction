# 🚀 IPO Success Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains the full pipeline and analysis for a capstone project aimed at predicting the short- and long-term success of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) using structured financial disclosures, macroeconomic indicators, and market sentiment features.

## 📌 Project Summary

Many IPOs underperform in the months following their public listing. This project builds a robust, interpretable machine learning framework to predict IPO success within 6 months and 3 years of listing. It integrates data from SEC EDGAR filings, stock performance, and economic conditions to help investors and analysts evaluate IPO viability.

## 📊 Data Sources

- SEC EDGAR: S-1, 10-K, and 10-Q filings
- Yahoo Finance: IPO stock price history (IPO date, +6M, +3Y)
- FRED: Federal Funds Rate, Inflation
- S&P 500: Price vs 30/50/200-day SMAs as sentiment proxies

---

## 🛠 Features Engineered

- Financial: Net margin, revenue growth (YoY/QoQ), asset turnover, debt-to-equity, cash ratio, ROC trends across 1Y–3Y
- Macroeconomic: Inflation, Fed rate at IPO date
- Market Sentiment: Relative position of S&P 500 index to its moving averages
- Company Metadata: SIC codes, incorporation age, filing frequency

## 🤖 Models Used

| Model        | 6-Month AUC | 3-Year AUC | Notes                           |
|--------------|-------------|------------|---------------------------------|
| LightGBM     | 0.7509      | 0.7714     | Best overall performance        |
| Neural Net   | 0.6777      | 0.7056     | Tuned with Optuna & PCA         |

Both models were trained using:
- Cross-validation with class imbalance handling
- Hyperparameter tuning via **Optuna**
- Feature importance analysis using **SHAP**

## 💹 Investment Simulation

To test the real-world utility of our predictions, we ran a simulated investment strategy:

- Initial Capital: $100,000
- Agents: Random, LightGBM, NN, Ensemble
- Rules: $100–200 per IPO based on predicted label

📈 LightGBM Agent Profit: `$61,116`  
📉 Random Agent Profit: `$6,334`  
This confirmed that model-guided investing yielded superior ROI.

## 📈 Key Findings

- IPOs performed better when launched during low inflation (<2%).
- Companies younger than 20 years showed higher 3-year success.
- Contrary to expectations, IPOs when S&P 500 was below SMA did better.
- Liquidity and macro factors** were more important than pure revenue growth.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- U.S.-only scope
- No unstructured text analysis (e.g., S-1 sentiment)
- Predictive power varies across sectors
- Requires periodic retraining due to macroeconomic shifts

---

## 📌 Future Work

- Add NLP on S-1 filings using SEC-BERT or FinBERT
- Sector-specific model tuning (Tech, Healthcare, etc.)
- Deploy model via REST API or interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Extend to global IPOs (Europe, India, Asia-Pacific)
